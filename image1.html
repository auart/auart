  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="First image" width="800">
  <p> chose this photo because it was one of the strongest options I had that could be cropped to 1920Ã—1080. The composition worked within those proportions, and I was able to use Curves adjustments to push the tonal range in a creative way. The rainbow effect adds a surreal layer of color, which makes the composition more visually striking even though the original shot was more straightforward.</p>
