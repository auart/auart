  <p>This photo worked well with the 5×7 crop because the subject still held together within those dimensions. I used Curves to shift the red, green, and blue channels individually, which created rainbow-like tones across the image. I liked this effect because it took a simple composition and gave it more energy and abstraction, turning it into something visually playful while still fitting the assignment’s parameters.</p>
