    <h2>Reflection #1</h2>
    <p>
     <p>Capturing images to me is like freezing a moment in time, but it’s also about making myself reflect on the world around me, both big and small. When I’m behind a camera, I start noticing things I wouldn’t normally stop for. Wide-angle shots make me think about the composition and framing of the whole world, how different parts balance each other. On the other hand, macro shots pull me into the smallest details of a simple object, showing me textures and forms that would normally go unseen. Where normally I struggle to focus, photography makes me pay attention. It sharpens how I see and makes me realize that every scene can be looked at in a hundred different ways and angles.</p>

<p>As I move through this semester and work on the ten different projects, I know each one will stand on its own, but I also want them to connect as a bigger body of work. The common thread for me is color and vibration. I love the full spectrum of colors, layering them, bending them, and sometimes stripping them away. If I work in black and white or with just a few colors, I want the image to still pop and vibrate. That principle comes straight from the linework I use in my glass art. My goal is to hypnotize my viewer a little, to create something that pulls them in. I want people to feel wonder, amazement, or even confusion, and then, in that moment of disorientation, start to make their own meaning or reality from what they see.</p>

<p>Thinking about our world right now, I often feel how chaotic it is, especially living in or around a big city. The noise, the stress, the constant movement can be overwhelming. Through photography and image making, I want to create a kind of escape for my viewers. If the world is full of chaos, then my work should give people a pocket of calm, or even a sense of full immersion, where they can take a second away from all that stress. That doesn’t mean pretending the chaos isn’t there; sometimes, I’ll use it directly in my images. However, I want to show that there are other ways of seeing, other spaces to step into, even if it’s just for a moment.</p>

<p>My approach as a media maker this semester is all about exploration. My attitude is rooted in curiosity. I want to try new techniques while also playing around with older ones I’ve used before, seeing how they can stretch or bend in new directions. For me, it’s about pushing my boundaries, experimenting with different forms of art, and finding new ways to express ideas. I don’t expect everything to work perfectly, but I know each project is a step forward. In the end, I want to build a collection of work that shows growth, risks, and a personal vision that evolves across the semester.</p>

<p>That’s what image making means to me right now: noticing, experimenting, and creating a body of work that feels alive, connected, and open to interpretation.

  <h2>Reflection #2</h2>

<p>When I read the article “AI slop,” I thought it was a bit dramatic. People have been desensitized by news, violence, and propaganda since the beginning of time. AI might be speeding it up, but it’s not new. For me, it still comes down to common sense and whether people care enough to look for the truth. If you care, you’ll do the research. If not, you’ll stay influenced like people always have. I actually find AI inspiring. We’ve created almost a new life form. Sure, there’s going to be bad stuff made with it, but there is also beauty and usefulness. It might end up being the start of the end, or it might be something that saves us in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>I don’t feel like my feed is full of AI slop. I mostly follow handmade art or people who inspire me. Sometimes I get pulled into mindless clips from YouTube shorts, but even that fascinates me to see how fast media is changing through streaming and YouTube stars. I try to only pay attention to things that benefit me or inspire me. I see AI like a river; it's going to flow no matter what. The best we can do is learn to drink from it, maybe with the use of a filter, dam it up when needed, and understand how it flows. Misinformation has always existed, and yes, it's dangerous for people who don't know better, but that’s nothing new; AI just amplifies it.</p>

<p>I think AI has huge potential to help people in many ways. Whether it's through medical advancements, technological advancements, or even helps creative people work faster and easier. In Art and music, AI already helps with editing, sampling, and separating sounds. That kind of speed can actually free artists to focus more on creating. In fact, our last assignment, where we had to use Photoshop masking, involved the use of AI to gauge the border of something, where you used to have to painstakingly trace the object. My only fear is AI going past the point of control. There should definitely be regulations around things like AI weapons or surveillance systems. We don't want to turn into SKYnet.</p>

<p>Not everyone will be able to see only what inspires them. Algorithms are strong, and most people will fall into AI slop without even realizing it. Even I do sometimes. But not all AI content is bad; some of it can be relaxing or even good for people. The article mentions “eye balm,” showing stuff like snowy cabins with peaceful fires or even fake, cute cat videos. The problem arises when you spend too much time living in that fake comfort instead of real life.</p>

<p>In the future, AI will automate a lot of our daily lives and jobs and create most of the content we see. It’ll feel strange at first, but just like social media felt, it will eventually become part of the norm. I’m not that worried, people will adapt, some using it for creativity, others won’t. I think AI will help artists already using tech, while handcrafted work will always be revered as the “real stuff”. I'm not an expert, but I think things will be okay in the long run. Humanity has always evolved with new tools, and AI is just the next one.</p>
