    <p>
     <p>Capturing images to me is like freezing a moment in time, but it’s also about making myself reflect on the world around me, both big and small. When I’m behind a camera, I start noticing things I wouldn’t normally stop for. Wide-angle shots make me think about the composition and framing of the whole world, how different parts balance each other. On the other hand, macro shots pull me into the smallest details of a simple object, showing me textures and forms that would normally go unseen. Where normally I struggle to focus, photography makes me pay attention. It sharpens how I see and makes me realize that every scene can be looked at in a hundred different ways and angles.</p>

<p>As I move through this semester and work on the ten different projects, I know each one will stand on its own, but I also want them to connect as a bigger body of work. The common thread for me is color and vibration. I love the full spectrum of colors, layering them, bending them, and sometimes stripping them away. If I work in black and white or with just a few colors, I want the image to still pop and vibrate. That principle comes straight from the linework I use in my glass art. My goal is to hypnotize my viewer a little, to create something that pulls them in. I want people to feel wonder, amazement, or even confusion, and then, in that moment of disorientation, start to make their own meaning or reality from what they see.</p>

<p>Thinking about our world right now, I often feel how chaotic it is, especially living in or around a big city. The noise, the stress, the constant movement can be overwhelming. Through photography and image making, I want to create a kind of escape for my viewers. If the world is full of chaos, then my work should give people a pocket of calm, or even a sense of full immersion, where they can take a second away from all that stress. That doesn’t mean pretending the chaos isn’t there; sometimes, I’ll use it directly in my images. However, I want to show that there are other ways of seeing, other spaces to step into, even if it’s just for a moment.</p>

<p>My approach as a media maker this semester is all about exploration. My attitude is rooted in curiosity. I want to try new techniques while also playing around with older ones I’ve used before, seeing how they can stretch or bend in new directions. For me, it’s about pushing my boundaries, experimenting with different forms of art, and finding new ways to express ideas. I don’t expect everything to work perfectly, but I know each project is a step forward. In the end, I want to build a collection of work that shows growth, risks, and a personal vision that evolves across the semester.</p>

<p>That’s what image making means to me right now: noticing, experimenting, and creating a body of work that feels alive, connected, and open to interpretation.
