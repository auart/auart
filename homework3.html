  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    For my depth of field assignment, I chose to use the Hunter College sign because I felt it best demonstrated the contrast between shallow and deep depth of field. In the shallow depth of field photo, the word “Hunter” is in sharp focus, while “College” begins to blur and the rest of the sign is almost unreadable. The people in the background, the air conditioning unit, and the trees are also very blurry, which helps emphasize the subject. In the deep depth of field version, more details throughout the frame are clearer and sharper, giving the overall image a more balanced crispness. For the edited version, I chose to focus specifically on “Hunter College” while intentionally blurring out the surrounding areas to direct attention to the words themselves.

    For the Camera RAW editing portion, I worked on correcting images that were overexposed. I adjusted the white balance to bring the tones closer to natural and made additional changes to the light settings to recover details lost in the highlights. I also experimented with adjusting the histogram chart at the top, which helped me refine the overall exposure and contrast in the images. These edits gave the pictures more depth, detail, and balance, while also showing me how much control Camera RAW provides when working with lighting and color correction.
